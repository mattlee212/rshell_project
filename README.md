# Intro:
Our program will be able to function as a basic shell that will be able to take in inputs that classify as executables, arguments, and/or connectors. We will be using a composite pattern to implement our shell so that we can add new functions to our program without risk of introducing bugs within a working system. The general format of how our inputs will be “ingested” with the cin function within the STL library <iostream> will be processed in a general format of: <dir name>$ <executable> [possible argument] [possible connector]. These inputs will be transformed into classes and structures with an interface through the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
